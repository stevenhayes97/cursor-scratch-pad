"""Static NFL stadium reference data: coordinates + roof type.

Small, stable dataset (32 teams share a handful of stadiums) -- easier and
more reliable for weather lookups than geocoding a city name at runtime.
Roof: "outdoor", "dome" (always closed), or "retractable" (treated as
outdoor-capable; a retractable roof rarely materially changes fantasy
weather advice, but we surface it so the agent can note the uncertainty).
